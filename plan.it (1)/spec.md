### Event Management
- Create new events with basic information (name, guest count as main detail field immediately after name and client selection, date, time, venue selection from directory, client assignment)

- **Fixed venue selection logic in event creation and editing to ensure selected venues are correctly stored in the backend and accurately retrieved when editing events**

- **Fixed staff assignment preservation ensuring all staff assignment values remain stable and persist correctly through edits without being lost or cleared**
- **Corrected backend `updateEvent` function implementation that maintains staff assignments by preserving the existing `staff` array from the original event instead of overwriting with empty values**
